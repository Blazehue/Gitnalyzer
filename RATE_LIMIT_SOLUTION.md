# üö® GitHub API Rate Limit Issue - SOLUTION

## Problem
You're getting "Failed to fetch user data" because you've exceeded GitHub's API rate limit.

## Rate Limits
- **Without Token**: 60 requests/hour per IP address
- **With Token**: 5,000 requests/hour

## Solution: Add GitHub Personal Access Token

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Gitnalyzer App"
4. Select scopes: **public_repo** (or just leave all unchecked for public data)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Add Token to Your Project

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

2. Restart the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify It Works

The application will now use your token and you'll have 5,000 requests/hour!

## Alternative: Wait for Rate Limit Reset

If you don't want to use a token right now:
- Wait 1 hour for the rate limit to reset
- Use sparingly (only a few searches per hour)

## Check Your Current Rate Limit

Run this command:
```bash
curl https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```

Or visit: https://api.github.com/rate_limit in your browser

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit `.env.local` to Git** - it's already in `.gitignore`
‚ö†Ô∏è **Never share your token publicly**
‚úÖ **Token is optional** - app works without it, just with lower limits
‚úÖ **Token only needs public repo access** - no private data

## For Production Deployment

Add the environment variable in your hosting platform:
- **Vercel**: Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- **Netlify**: Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- **Others**: Follow their documentation for env vars
